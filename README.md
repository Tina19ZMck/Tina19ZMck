Analysis of the problems of network security and countermeasures
With the rapid development of the Internet, the application of the Internet in various fields has made positive progress, and the Internet has become an important auxiliary means in many fields, playing a positive role in promoting work efficiency and changing lifestyles. However, with the increase of personal information on the Internet and people's reliance on the Internet, the issue of network security has become an important factor limiting the development of the Internet. At the same time, network security issues also have serious impact and threat to users' information and property. For this reason, we should pay enough attention to network security, start from the existing problems of network security, analyze the causes of the problem, develop specific strategies to ensure that network security problems are effectively solved, improve network security, and create a safe and stable network environment.

First, the concept of network security analysis

Network security is essentially information security on the network, which means that the data flowing and saved in the network system is not subject to accidental or malicious damage, leakage, change, the system works continuously and normally, and the network service is not interrupted. In a broad sense, all technologies and theories related to the confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and controllability of network information are the areas to be studied by network security.

Second, the main problems of network security analysis

The current network security problems exposed, including two major aspects, namely, the network security problems caused by natural factors and human factors caused by the network security problems, the following focus on the analysis of these two network security problems.

1. Natural factors and incidental factors caused by network security problems

Computer system hardware and communication facilities are highly susceptible to the impact of the natural environment, such as: various natural disasters (such as earthquakes, mudslides, floods, storms, building damage, etc.) pose a threat to the computer network. There are also some episodic factors, such as power failure, equipment malfunction, and certain vulnerabilities left in the software development process, which also pose serious threats to the computer network. In addition, inadequate regulations, low security management, operational errors, malpractice, etc. can pose a threat to network security.

2. Network security problems caused by human factors

From the perspective of the actual use of computer networks, network security problems caused by human factors are mainly manifested in the following areas.

(1) Insecurity in network applications

In the application of the network, because the network has more open characteristics, so the transmission and exchange of information in the network is very frequent, and the resulting information security has become the main problem facing the network security. In the Internet, users need to ensure that their network terminals belong to the open state due to the real demand of data transmission, which gives others the opportunity to implant computer viruses such as Trojan horses. Therefore, the problem of insecurity in network use is an important category of network security problems.

(2) Security vulnerabilities and defects in the operating system itself

In the network application, the operating system is an important software system for the network end-user. Although the operating system will pay great attention to the security settings during the development process and play a certain role in security protection in use, with the upgrading of network hacking methods, the security loopholes and defects of the operating system itself are gradually cracked by network hackers, thus bringing a greater impact on the information and financial security of network users. For this reason, it is necessary to pay enough attention to the security loopholes and defects of the operating system itself and take active measures to make up for them.

(3) Security loopholes and limitations of network firewalls

In order to improve the security defense of network end-users, the network firewall system is an important network terminal defense system. But troubled by a variety of factors and the limitations of the network firewall technology, in the actual use of the process, the network firewall inevitably exists security loopholes and limitations, this defect leads to the network firewall can only resist general network attacks, once encountered with upgraded versions of computer viruses, will not be able to form the protection of the system, and then cause serious impact on network security.

Third, the network security problem of the response strategy analysis

Considering the serious impact caused by network security problems and the importance of network security, network security problems should be carefully analyzed in the process of network use, and should start from the actual development of the network, around the problems of network security, and develop specific coping strategies to ensure that network security problems are effectively solved, improve the security and reliability of the network, promote the rapid and healthy development of the network, and provide a safe network environment. To this end, the following aspects should be used to develop strategies to deal with network security problems.

1. Establish a perfect network security management system to cope with network security emergencies.

In order to prevent the network system suddenly encountered outside factors and security problems, the network should be used in the process, according to their own needs, the establishment of a sound network security management system to ensure that the network security problems can have sufficient foresight, and to take effective measures to deal with network security emergencies. Considering the real impact and threats to network security, the network system and data should be backed up on the basis of establishing a perfect network security management system to avoid data damage or loss caused by external factors.

2. Timely update the operating system and plug the security loopholes of the operating system.

From the current development of computer operating system, the research and development department of the operating system can realize the loopholes and defects of the operating system after using it for a period of time, and can effectively plug the security loopholes of the operating system by regularly upgrading and updating the operating system, so as to meet the security performance index of the operating system and improve the defense ability of the operating system. Therefore, the operating system should be updated in a timely manner to prevent problems before they occur.

3. Install antivirus software in the network terminal system to improve the defense capability.

From the current network use process, computer viruses, as a special code, cannot be fundamentally eliminated. In order to ensure that the network terminal can meet the security performance requirements, antivirus software should be installed in the network terminal system to regularly kill the virus on the network terminal system to ensure that the network terminal system can resist virus attacks and improve the security of the network terminal system. In the current network protection, the installation of antivirus software is an effective way to protect system security and should be widely adopted.

4. Install a high version of the firewall, using a combination of firewall and password to improve security.

For computer terminals, firewalls are important for defending against external attacks to improve system security. For this reason, a high version of firewall should be installed on the computer terminal to improve the defense capability of the firewall to meet the defense needs of the computer terminal, and the combination of firewall and password can also be used to improve the security of the firewall and the computer terminal to effectively solve the network security problem.

    Network security issues should not be ignored, we should take a variety of means to effectively improve the level of network security to meet the new needs of network security development.
